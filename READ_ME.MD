# Data Structures in Rust

This repository contains my personal implementations of various data structures. I build these as I encounter them in professional environments, personal projects, or during my continuous learning journey.

All implementations are written exclusively in Rust to practice memory management and idiomatic coding patterns.

## Goals
- Implement data structures from scratch.
- Deepen understanding of Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
- Maintain clean and tested code.

## Current Structures
- Linked List (Still WIP)

## Incoming structures
- Queue (Non Blockin, Blocking and Thread Safe)
- BST (Binary Search Tree)
- HashTable (Sync and Concurrent)
- DLL (Doubly Linked List)

## Usage
To run the tests and ensure everything is working correctly, use Cargo:

``git clone https://github.com/Malolpv/data_structures.git``

``cd data_structures``

``cargo test``
